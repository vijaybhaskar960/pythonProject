In pytest, the scope parameter is used to define the lifetime of fixtures, which are reusable objects that provide test data and/or setup/teardown actions for your tests.

The scope parameter can be used with the @pytest.fixture decorator to set the fixture's lifetime to one of the following levels:

function (default): The fixture will be created and destroyed once per test function that uses it.
class: The fixture will be created and destroyed once per test class. All test methods within the same class will share the same instance of the fixture.
module: The fixture will be created and destroyed once per test module. All test functions within the same module will share the same instance of the fixture.
session: The fixture will be created and destroyed once per pytest session. All test functions across all test modules will share the same instance of the fixture.


Using the appropriate scope parameter can help improve the efficiency of your tests by reducing the number of times fixtures need to be created and destroyed.
For example, if you have a fixture that creates a database connection, you may want to use a session-scoped fixture so that the database connection is only created once for all your tests, rather than once per test function or module.
